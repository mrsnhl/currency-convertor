To use the repository

1. go to `/backend` and run

`npm install`

this would install cors and express

then start the server at port 4000 by running

`$ node index.js`

Now go inside the frontend folder and open the index.js file

Click on the button - you would see that the app fetches the value of pi from the backend.
